Coffee Shop App

Write a class called CoffeeShop, which has three instance variables:

1. name : a string (basically, of the shop)
2. menu : an array of items (of object type), with each item containing the item (name of the item), type (whether food or a drink) and price.
3. orders : an empty array

and seven methods:

1. addOrder: adds the name of the item to the end of the orders array if it exists on the menu. Otherwise, return "This item is currently unavailable!"
2. fulfillOrder: if the orders array is not empty, return "The {item} is ready!". If the orders array is empty, return "All orders have been fulfilled!"
3. listOrders: returns the list of orders taken, otherwise, an empty array.
4. dueAmount: returns the total amount due for the orders taken.
5. cheapestItem: returns the name of the cheapest item on the menu.
6. drinksOnly: returns only the item names of type drink from the menu.
7. foodOnly: returns only the item names of type food from the menu.

IMPORTANT: Orders are fulfilled in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) order.
NOTES:  Round off due amount up to two decimal places.
